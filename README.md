# Guess_The_Number-Python- It is a small python script which guesses the number based on the user inputs.
To play, the game selects a mystery number and the player enters their initial guess. P
layers receive feedback on whether their guess is greater than or less than the mystery number. 
The player continues to make a series of educated guesses to further eliminate potential numbers until he/she loses all its lives.
